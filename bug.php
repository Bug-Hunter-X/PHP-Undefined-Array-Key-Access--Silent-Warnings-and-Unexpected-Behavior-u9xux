In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["a"] = 1;
$myArray["b"] = 2;
$myArray[1] = 3; // Numeric key

// Accessing non-existent keys
echo $myArray["c"]; //Notice: Undefined index: c in ...
echo $myArray[2]; //Notice: Undefined index: 2 in ...

//This will produce a warning, not an error.

//To prevent the warning, you can use isset() or array_key_exists():
if (isset($myArray["c"])) {
  echo $myArray["c"];
} else {
  echo "Key 'c' not found";
}
```

This code will generate warnings because the keys "c" and 2 are not present in the array. The warnings might not always halt script execution, leading to unexpected behavior.  PHP's loose typing often hides these issues until they surface in unexpected ways. The issue is exacerbated when dealing with external data where key presence isn't guaranteed.
